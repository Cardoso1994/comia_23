	abstract = {A tweet polarity classifier is presented with four categories: positive, neutral, negative and no opinion. A grouping genetic algorithm performs feature extraction on the reviews. The feature definition is based on entropy and semantic context described as the relative positions between words. The feature selection is flexible because it is customized to each word studied in the reviews. The algorithm has been applied with two corpuses written in Spanish, of 3,413 tweets and more than 63,000 tweets, to classify an evaluation set of 1,899 reviews. The results were evaluated by the metrics M−F1 and accuracy. The algorithm has improved the results of both metrics and on both corpuses compared to the previous literature works, achieving a M−F1 of 0.640 and an accuracy of 0.689. The flexibility property in feature extraction has been the major qualitative improvement of the classifier.},

The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal `hidden'units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure1.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

@article{WANG2020101686,
	abstract = {In this study, a Bayesian classifier with the multivariate distribution based on the D-vine copula model is developed and evaluated for the awake/drowsiness interpretation during the power nap. The objective is to consider the correlation among the features into the automatic classification algorithm. A power nap is a short sleep process, which is commonly considered as a supplement to the insufficient overnight sleep. It may involve the states of awake and drowsiness. Neurophysiological features are extracted from the EEGs (electroencephalography) and EOGs (electrooculography), which are synchronously recorded during one's short nap after lunch. The multivariate distribution of features is decomposed into independency and dependency products according to the D-vine copula model. The independency product is the marginal probability density function of the features. The dependency product consists of pair-copula functions. The marginal probability density is estimated by the kernel function and k-nearest-neighbor density respectively. The parameters of pair-copula functions are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation. In total, 8 healthy subjects were involved. The comparison results showed that the Bayesian classifier with the multivariate distribution based on the D-vine copula model obtained quite satisfied classification accuracy. The developed method introduced a feasible way to construct the multivariate distribution, which can enhance the classification performance of Bayesian classifier when dealing with the complex correlation of features in actual cases.},

@article{Anjaria:2014wl,
	abstract = {Online microblog-based social networks have been used for expressing public opinions through short messages. Among popular microblogs, Twitter has attracted the attention of several researchers in areas like predicting the consumer brands, democratic electoral events, movie box office, popularity of celebrities, the stock market, etc. Sentiment analysis over a Twitter-based social network offers a fast and efficient way of monitoring the public sentiment. This paper studies the sentiment prediction task over Twitter using machine-learning techniques, with the consideration of Twitter-specific social network structure such as retweet. We also concentrate on finding both direct and extended terms related to the event and thereby understanding its effect. We employed supervised machine-learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, maximum entropy and artificial neural networks to classify the Twitter data using unigram, bigram and unigram + bigram (hybrid) feature extraction model for the case study of US Presidential Elections 2012 and Karnataka State Assembly Elections (India) 2013. Further, we combined the results of sentiment analysis with the influence factor generated from the retweet count to improve the prediction accuracy of the task. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM outperforms all other classifiers with maximum accuracy of 88 {\%} in predicting the outcome of US Elections 2012, and 68 {\%} for Indian State Assembly Elections 2013.},

@article{10.1162/coli.08-012-R1-06-90,
	abstract = {{Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word's prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system's ability to identify when an instance is neutral.}},

	abstract = {With their blistering expansions in recent years, popular on-line social sites such
as Twitter, Facebook and Bebo, have become some of the major news sources as well
as the most effective channels for viral marketing nowadays. However, alongside these
promising features comes the threat of misinformation propagation which can lead to
undesirable effects, such as the widespread panic in the general public due to faulty
swine flu tweets on Twitter in 2009. Due to the huge magnitude of online social network
(OSN) users and the highly clustered structures commonly observed in these kinds of
networks, it poses a substantial challenge to efficiently contain viral spread of
misinformation in large-scale social networks.In this paper, we focus on how to limit
viral propagation of misinformation in OSNs. Particularly, we study a set of problems,
namely the β1T -- Node Protectors, which aims to find the smallest set of highly influential
nodes whose decontamination with good information helps to contain the viral spread
of misinformation, initiated from the set I, to a desired ratio (1 − β) in T time
steps. In this family set, we analyze and present solutions including inapproximability
result, greedy algorithms that provide better lower bounds on the number of selected
nodes, and a community-based heuristic method for the Node Protector problems. To
verify our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on real world traces including
NetHEPT, NetHEPT_WC and Facebook networks. Empirical results indicate that our methods
are among the best ones for hinting out those important nodes in comparison with other
available methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study and evaluate rumor-like methods for combating the spread of
rumors on a social network. We model rumor spread as a diffusion process on a network
and suggest the use of an "anti-rumor" process similar to the rumor process. We study
two natural models by which these anti-rumors may arise. The main metrics we study
are the belief time, i.e., the duration for which a person believes the rumor to be
true and point of decline, i.e., point after which anti-rumor process dominates the
rumor process. We evaluate our methods by simulating rumor spread and anti-rumor spread
on a data set derived from the social networking site Twitter and on a synthetic network
generated according to the Watts and Strogatz model. We find that the lifetime of
a rumor increases if the delay in detecting it increases, and the relationship is
at least linear. Further our findings show that coupling the detection and anti-rumor
strategy by embedding agents in the network, we call them beacons, is an effective
means of fighting the spread of rumor, even if these beacons do not share information.},

understand the properties of underlying media and model communication patterns. As
Twitter gains in popularity, it has also become a venue to broadcast rumors and misinformation.
We use epidemiological models to characterize information cascades in twitter resulting
from both news and rumors. Specifically, we use the SEIZ enhanced epidemic model that
explicitly recognizes skeptics to characterize eight events across the world and spanning
a range of event types. We demonstrate that our approach is accurate at capturing
diffusion in these events. Our approach can be fruitfully combined with other strategies
that use content modeling and graph theoretic features to detect (and possibly disrupt)
rumors.},

Individuals meet pairwise and exchange information, which is modeled as both individuals adopting the average of their pre-meeting beliefs. ``Forceful'' agents influence the beliefs of (some of) the other individuals they meet, but do not change their own opinions. We characterize how the presence of forceful agents interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even forceful agents obtain some information from others, we first show that all beliefs converge to a stochastic consensus. Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation by providing bounds or exact results on the gap between the consensus value and the benchmark without forceful agents (where there is efficient information aggregation). The worst outcomes obtain when there are several forceful agents who update their beliefs only on the basis of information from individuals that have been influenced by them.},

	abstract = {In today's world, online social media plays a vital role during real world events,
especially crisis events. There are both positive and negative effects of social media
coverage of events, it can be used by authorities for effective disaster management
or by malicious entities to spread rumors and fake news. The aim of this paper, is
to highlight the role of Twitter, during Hurricane Sandy (2012) to spread fake images
about the disaster. We identified 10,350 unique tweets containing fake images that
were circulated on Twitter, during Hurricane Sandy. We performed a characterization
analysis, to understand the temporal, social reputation and influence patterns for
the spread of fake images. Eighty six percent of tweets spreading the fake images
were retweets, hence very few were original tweets. Our results showed that top thirty
users out of 10,215 users (0.3%) resulted in 90% of the retweets of fake images; also
network links such as follower relationships of Twitter, contributed very less (only
11%) to the spread of these fake photos URLs. Next, we used classification models,
to distinguish fake images from real images of Hurricane Sandy. Best results were
obtained from Decision Tree classifier, we got 97% accuracy in predicting fake images
from real. Also, tweet based features were very effective in distinguishing fake images
tweets from real, while the performance of user based features was very poor. Our
results, showed that, automated techniques can be used in identifying real images
from fake images posted on Twitter.},

	abstract = {A growing literature is emerging on the believability and spread of disinformation, such as fake news, over social networks. However, little is known about the degree to which malicious actors can use social media to covertly affect behavior with disinformation. A lab-based randomized controlled experiment was conducted with 233 undergraduate students to investigate the behavioral effects of fake news. It was found that even short (under 5-min) exposure to fake news was able to significantly modify the unconscious behavior of individuals. This paper provides initial evidence that fake news can be used to covertly modify behavior, it argues that current approaches to mitigating fake news, and disinformation in general, are insufficient to protect social media users from this threat, and it highlights the implications of this for democracy. It raises the need for an urgent cross-sectoral effort to investigate, protect against, and mitigate the risks of covert, widespread and decentralized behavior modification over online social networks.},
