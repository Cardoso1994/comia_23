abstract = {A growing literature is emerging on the believability and spread of disinformation, such as fake news, over social networks. However, little is known about the degree to which malicious actors can use social media to covertly affect behavior with disinformation. A lab-based randomized controlled experiment was conducted with 233 undergraduate students to investigate the behavioral effects of fake news. It was found that even short (under 5-min) exposure to fake news was able to significantly modify the unconscious behavior of individuals. This paper provides initial evidence that fake news can be used to covertly modify behavior, it argues that current approaches to mitigating fake news, and disinformation in general, are insufficient to protect social media users from this threat, and it highlights the implications of this for democracy. It raises the need for an urgent cross-sectoral effort to investigate, protect against, and mitigate the risks of covert, widespread and decentralized behavior modification over online social networks.}}

abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing.We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet.To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

ABSTRACT = {Sentiment analysis is a new tool on new social media platforms, locations very attractive to the global consumer industry to investigate, due to their relevance and increased consumption in a pandemic. This study aims to determine the predominant sentiment and emotions on Twitter through a sentiment analysis in the consumer electronics industry, according to the top 30 companies of the Consumer Electronic Show 2020, by analyzing 96,000 tweets with a total of 273,221 words. The methodology used is quantitative, of a descriptive type, that integrates the study of emotions and sentiment through a statistical analysis of the tweets with R. The main results identify that the predominant sentiment is of positive assessment and the emotions of anticipation and confidence were the most representative. The contribution of this research is to provide empirical evidence of the global consumer electronics industry for correct decision-making through a data language analysis procedure on Twitter.},

abstract="Social media mainly provides an unparalleled chance to detect depression early in young adults. Depression is an illness that so often requires the self-reporting of symptoms. Social networking sites can provide an ample amount of data and information to train an efficient deep learning model. We aim to perform depression analysis on Twitter by analyzing its linguistic markers, making it plausible to create a deep learning model capable of providing an individual discernment into their mental health much earlier than the traditional approaches. We use two models to detect depressive users using their tweets on this conquest, a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The LSTM model outperforms simple RNN by having a validation accuracy of 96.21 and a validation loss of 0.1077. Both models were trained on a single customized dataset, half of which was from sentiment140, and the other half was extracted from Twitter using the Twitter API.",

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid model for sentiment analysis. The model leverages the strengths of both the Transformer model, represented by the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and the Recurrent Neural Network, represented by Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The RoBERTa model provides the capability to project the texts into a discriminative embedding space through its attention mechanism, while the GRU model captures the long-range dependencies of the embedding and addresses the vanishing gradients problem. To overcome the challenge of imbalanced datasets in sentiment analysis, this paper also proposes the use of data augmentation with word embeddings by over-sampling the minority classes. This enhances the representation capacity of the model, making it more robust and accurate in handling the sentiment classification task. The proposed RoBERTa-GRU model was evaluated on three widely used sentiment analysis datasets: IMDb, Sentiment140, and Twitter US Airline Sentiment. The results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 94.63% on IMDb, 89.59% on Sentiment140, and 91.52% on Twitter US Airline Sentiment. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RoBERTa-GRU hybrid model in sentiment analysis.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we introduce the T-MexNeg corpus of Tweets written in Mexican Spanish. It consists of 13,704 Tweets, of which 4895 contain negation structures. We performed an analysis of negation statements embedded in the language employed on social media. This research paper aims to present the annotation guidelines along with a novel resource targeted at the negation detection task. The corpus was manually annotated with labels of negation cue, scope, and, event. We report the analysis of the inter-annotator agreement for all the components of the negation structure. This resource is freely available. Furthermore, we performed various experiments to automatically identify negation using the T-MexNeg corpus and the SFU ReviewSP-NEG for training a machine learning algorithm. By comparing two different methodologies, one based on a dictionary and the other based on the Conditional Random Fields algorithm, we found that the results of negation identification on Twitter are lower when the model is trained on the SFU ReviewSP-NEG Corpus. Therefore, this paper shows the importance of having resources built specifically to deal with social media language.},

abstract="Since the invention of the Internet, and with the rise of social networks, information is available to all users quickly and in large quantities. One of the main sources of information on social networks is news. Among the possible options available for users to express their opinion or comment about some topic Twitter is a great tool for its users' to express their thoughts, this makes tweets the source of data and one of the central points of this work. The content of these opinions is highly emotionally charged. By analyzing user's comments about a news item, it is possible to determine its polarity and in turn use it as an indicator of the controversy of the news. Controversy tells us how the news affected its consumers, since if the responses are highly controversial it means that the readers opinions differed greatly, and that there was no common agreement on the news. Since there was no consensus in the responses, it can be inferred that there was a heated discussion in the comments. Those heated discussions are striking because they indicate which types of news generate more conflicts among readers and which do not.",

Our improved deep neural network models were trained on augmented data and pseudo labeled examples. Our LSTM classifier receives a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.6425 to rank first overall on the Facebook subtask of the shared task. On the social media sub-task, our CNN-LSTM model records a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.5920 to place third overall.",

abstract = {Advances in neural networks contributed to the fast development of Natural Language Processing systems. As a result, Question Answering systems have evolved and can classify and answer questions in an intuitive yet communicative way. However, the lack of large volumes of labeled data prevents large-scale training and development of Question Answering systems, confirming the need for further research. This paper aims to handle this real-world problem of lack of labeled datasets by applying a pseudo-labeling technique relying on a neural network transformer model DistilBERT. In order to evaluate our contribution, we examined the performance of a text classification transformer model that was fine-tuned on the data subject to prior pseudo-labeling. Research has shown the usefulness of the applied pseudo-labeling technique on a neural network text classification transformer model DistilBERT. The results of our analysis indicated that the model with additional pseudo-labeled data achieved the best results among other compared neural network architectures. Based on that result, Question Answering systems may be directly improved by enriching their training steps with additional data acquired cost-effectively.}
